"# Ling131_FinalProject"
Ben Siege and Midgie Williams

in main:
Trains a part of speech tagger on the Brown News Corpus.
Uses that tagger to tag the desired input.
Then uses the input and tagger to create a haiku with (extremely) loosely accurate syntax

in haiku:
estimates the number of syllables in a word using vowel information and some (very) simple phonology
then uses the parts of speech and syllable counts for each word to create a three line poem, where the first line has 5 syllables, the second 7 and the third 5.
